# fylr plugins are built by fylr-build-plugin, the build driver that knows how
# a fylr plugin is put together (compile, assemble build/, zip, seal, loca).
# This Makefile is a thin shim for muscle memory — all logic lives in the
# tool. @latest always resolves the tool's newest release, so plugins pick up
# fixes without being touched; an incompatible tool change would come as a new
# major version (import path .../v2), which is the only event that changes
# this line.
#
# Tools needed (each only for the features this plugin uses):
#   go       runs fylr-build-plugin — https://go.dev/dl/
#   coffee   CoffeeScript 1.x:  npm install -g coffeescript@1.12.7
#   sass     npm install -g sass
FYLR_BUILD_PLUGIN ?= go run github.com/programmfabrik/fylr-build-plugin@latest

# The tool itself reads NO environment variables — everything is passed as
# flags. The release workflow's RELEASE_TAG / ZIP_NAME env is translated into
# flags right here.
RELEASE_FLAGS = $(if $(RELEASE_TAG),-release "$(RELEASE_TAG)")
ZIP_FLAGS = $(RELEASE_FLAGS) $(if $(ZIP_NAME),-out "$(ZIP_NAME)")

* `objNew`: The new data of the currently saved object. This includes the record for top level objects, the nested record for nested objects.
* `objCurr`: This data is the data as found in the database. It represents the old / current version of the data.
* `dataPath`: During the recursive crawling of the data, the dataPath is extended for each iteration. It contains the path to the data starting from the top level.
* `dataPathCurr`: Same as `dataPath` but for the current object data.

If an Exception is caught the event is written using the type `FORMULA_COLUMNS_ERROR`.

> A known limitation is that the callback for a nested record does not know which record idx it is currently in.","## Formula Field Code
